🚀 QA Automation Pipeline with Playwright + GitHub Actions + CLI

📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete QA automation pipeline that integrates:

Playwright for end-to-end testing

Custom CLI tool (qa-run) to trigger smoke/regression suites across environments

GitHub Actions CI/CD to run tests on PRs and pushes

Multi-browser testing (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)

HTML reports as artifacts in CI/CD

The goal is to simulate a real-world DevOps QA workflow, showing how automation, CI/CD, and custom tooling can work together.
